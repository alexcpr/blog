</ul><p>As a developer, I’m using <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> every day to talk with people and friends about programming stuff, but I am mainly in programming Discord servers and I was, especially in a Discord server for a few days, which have ~25K members and I saw some people referring people to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, which is a bad information source to learn programming.

With everything we know about web development best practices, w3schools ability to remain that known, baffles us all.</p>

<p>I’m not the first one saying that w3schools is bad and writing about it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412103745/http://w3fools.com">This has already been done in the past</a>, the problem is that now they say that w3schools resolved these issues, well, I will show you they didn’t resolve all of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HTML</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You probably won’t believe me, but yes w3schools recommend to people to use Notepad for Windows users and TextEdit for Mac users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>« Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.</p>

    <p>However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).</p>

    <p>We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.</p>

    <p>Follow the four steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. »</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp">See it by yourself</a> <em>What does Linux users should use, though</em> 🤔</p>

    <p>I personally recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for simple code editor. For an IDE I recommend the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains tools</a></p>

    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp">HTML Formatting tutorial</a>, they recommend the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;b&gt;</code> tag, which is deprecated and should be replaced by CSS.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">HTML Basics tutorial</a>, they use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> attributes in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag instead of using CSS. Barely better <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_assets/images.asp">here</a>, they inline style into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">HTML Headings tutorial</a>, they inline style in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. Even in their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp">HTML Styles tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">HTML CSS tutorial</a>, they do so.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">HTML Links tutorial</a>, showing how to change default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code> colors they did this.</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  a:link {
      color: green;
      background-color: transparent;
      text-decoration: none;
  }
  a:visited {
      color: pink;
      background-color: transparent;
      text-decoration: none;
  }
  a:hover {
      color: red;
      background-color: transparent;
      text-decoration: underline;
  }
  a:active {
      color: yellow;
      background-color: transparent;
      text-decoration: underline;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Note that this time they used a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag!</em></p>

    <p>Although they could have just done it like this</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    a {
        text-decoration: none;
        background-color: transparent
    }
    a:link {
        color: green
    }
    a:visited {
        color: pink
    }
    a:active,
    a:hover {
        color: red;
        text-decoration: underline
    }
    a:active {
        color: #ff0
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  </code></pre>

    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp">HTML Layout tutorial</a>, they recommend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flex</code> and doesn’t even talk about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grid</code>, using the excuse that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flex</code> isn’t supported by IE10 and lower.
<img src="/assets/images/ie11-desktop.png" alt="IE 11 Desktop">
<img src="/assets/images/ie11-mobile.png" alt="IE 11 Mobile">
IE 11 Desktop works fine, but mobile doesn’t. Flex works partially on IE 11, as <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=flex">caniuse says</a>. However, it’s not a real problem since IE only represents ~2% of browser usage.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp">HTML Responsive tutorial</a>, they use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;media&gt;</code> attribute to show different content depending on the browser width. It’s better to use media queries in a separate CSS file.</li>
      <li>They have a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp">tutorial about XHTML</a>, which is obsolete since HTML5.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp">CSS Media Queries tutorial</a>, they use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;media&gt;</code> attribute to show different content depending on the browser width. It’s better to use media queries in a separate CSS file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>JavaScript:
    <ul>
      <li>In all their tutorials, including their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">JavaScript Variables tutorial</a> and “JavaScript Best Practices,” they use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code>, although nowadays you should be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> have been added since ES2015, and they are supported by IE11 (which represents almost 100% of current IE usage). You can write in ES2015 and convert your code to ES5 with tools such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.</li>
      <li>They mostly use string concatenation instead of string interpolation, which is very easy using template literals.</li>
      <li>They use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">===</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!==</code> in variable comparisons.</li>
      <li>They primarily show traditional functions instead of arrow functions, even when arrow functions would make more sense.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb">JavaScript introduction</a>, they show how JavaScript can modify HTML attribute values, but they inline the JavaScript inside an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onclick</code> attribute, which is a bad practice. They should have used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp">JavaScript Where To tutorial</a>, they don’t mention that when placing JavaScript code in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code>, you must use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defer</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> attribute.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp">JavaScript Output tutorial</a>, they mention that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.write</code> should be used for debugging only, but it shouldn’t even be mentioned.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">JavaScript Variables tutorial</a>, they provide examples of reporting several variables on the same line without assignment.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp">JavaScript Operators tutorial</a>, they don’t mention the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**</code> operator.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">JavaScript Data Types tutorial</a>, they state, “You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typeof null</code> is an object. It should be null.” It was a bug in the beginning, but this text could lead to the mistaken belief that this behavior will change someday.</li>
      <li>There is no tutorial/documentation about the modern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> API, only about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp">XMLHttpRequest</a>. <a href="https://blog.alexandrecipor.com/en/fetch-api">See why you should be using fetch and not XMLHttpRequest</a>.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp">JavaScript Objects tutorial</a>, they could have used short syntax for object methods like this:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="json">{
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 1,
    method() {
        // code of the method here
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp">JavaScript Events tutorial</a>, they teach a bad practice of using HTML events instead of using JavaScript events with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addEventListener</code> method.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">JavaScript Arrays tutorial</a>, they could have taught <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for...of</code> to iterate over an array like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for (const element of array) { ... }</code>.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp">JavaScript Hoisting tutorial</a>, it would be much easier using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp">JavaScript Best Practices tutorial</a>, declarations on top are now considered a bad practice, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> should be used. Using Parameter Defaults is now part of the syntax.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp">JavaScript Validation tutorial</a>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addEventListener</code> should be used, again.</li>
      <li>JavaScript Classes and Promises aren’t mentioned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>PHP:
    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">PHP Introduction</a>, PHP5 is used, which shows how outdated the tutorial is.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_install.asp">PHP Installation tutorial</a>, PHP5 is still used, and there is no real explanation on how to install PHP. It’s like saying, “Look at the documentation and figure it out; we won’t tell you about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">php -S</code> (the PHP internal web server for development).”</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_variables.asp">PHP Variables tutorial</a>, they use double quotes by default instead of single quotes, even without interpolation. They use global variables, which is considered a bad practice.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays.asp">PHP Arrays tutorial</a>, they use the old long syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code> instead of the short syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>.</li>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_intro.asp">PHP Ajax tutorial</a>, their JavaScript and PHP code are full of bad practices, and they don’t discuss the fact that nowadays you should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> API instead of AJAX. <a href="https://blog.alexandrecipor.com/en/fetch-api">See why you should be using fetch and not XMLHttpRequest</a>.</li>
      <li>There is no tutorial about hashing passwords.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bootstrap:
    <ul>
      <li>In their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp">Bootstrap Introduction</a>, they use Bootstrap 3, so there’s no need to go further.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>W3.JS:
    <ul>
      <li>Their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3js/default.asp">W3.JS</a> library is heavy (12KB) and doesn’t offer many features. W3.JS is like jQuery, heavy and less useful nowadays. In 2018, a library that allows direct interaction with the DOM is considered outdated, given the availability of modern UX libraries like React or VueJS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#fun-fact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fun Fact</h2>

<p>I was looking at the <a href="http://w3schools.invisionzone.com/">w3schools forum</a> and I found this <a href="http://w3schools.invisionzone.com/topic/57507-cloned-domain-from-w3schools/">thread</a> saying that someone cloned the w3schools site. The cloned version is available <a href="https://www.quanzhanketang.com/">here</a>. This is an outdated version of the w3schools site, so you can explore even more outdated tutorials. You can also see this meme by yourself:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/w3fools.png" alt="W3Fools Meme"></p>

<p>They were using HTML tables for layout, and by the way, this is not a lamp 😂. I’m sure you can still find some funny things they were doing a few years ago.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> If I forgot something, you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/">open an issue</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/alexcpr/blog">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> w3schools → 🗑, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">the MDN</a> instead 🕶</p>
