So, I decided, to alert a staff to do something about it, and the staff said that w3schools is sometimes outdated, but that it‚Äôs not a big problem. However, in fact, it is a big problem because as a starter when you learn something and do it all the time it‚Äôs hard to stop doing it even more if nobody alerts you about it. With everything we know about web development best practices, w3schools ability to remain that known, baffles us all. I‚Äôm not the first one saying that w3schools is bad and writing about it. This has already been done in the past, the problem is that now they say that w3schools resolved these issues, well, I will show you they didn‚Äôt resolve all of them. Example of bad practices that w3schools makes you learn HTML You probably won‚Äôt believe me, but yes w3schools recommend to people to use Notepad for Windows users and TextEdit for Mac users. ¬´ Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML. Follow the four steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. ¬ª See it by yourself What does Linux users should use, though ü§î I personally recommend VS Code or Sublime Text for simple code editor. For an IDE I recommend the Jetbrains tools In their HTML Formatting tutorial they recommend the use of &amp;#x3C;b&amp;#x3E; tag, which is deprecated and should be replaced by CSS. In their HTML Basics tutorial they use width and height attributes in a &amp;#x3C;img&amp;#x3E; tag instead using CSS. Barely better here they inline style into the &amp;#x3C;img&amp;#x3E; tag. In their HTML Headings tutorial they inline style in a &amp;#x3C;h1&amp;#x3E; tag. Even in their HTML Styles tutorial and HTML CSS tutorial they do so. In their HTML Links tutorial showing how to change default &amp;#x3C;a&amp;#x3E; colors they did this &amp;#x3C;style&amp;#x3E; a:link { color: green; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:visited { color: pink; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:hover { color: red; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } a:active { color: yellow; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } &amp;#x3C;/style&amp;#x3E; Note that this time they used a &amp;#x3C;style&amp;#x3E; tag! Although they could have just done it like this &amp;#x3C;style&amp;#x3E; a { text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent } a:link { color: green } a:visited { color: pink } a:active, a:hover { color: red; text-decoration: underline } a:active { color: #ff0 } &amp;#x3C;/style&amp;#x3E; In their HTML Layout tutorial they recommend float over flex and doesn‚Äôt even talk about grid and as an excuse they talk about flex not being supported by IE10 and lower. IE 11 Desktop works fine, but mobile doesn‚Äôt. Flex works partially on IE 11 as caniuse says. However, it‚Äôs not a real problem since IE only represents ~2% of browsers usage. In their HTML Responsive tutorial they use &amp;#x3C;media&amp;#x3E; attribute to show different content depending on browser width, don‚Äôt do that. Use media queries in a separate CSS file. They have a tutorial about XHTML, which is dead since HTML5. CSS In their CSS Media Queries tutorial they use &amp;#x3C;media&amp;#x3E; attribute to show different content depending on browser width, don‚Äôt do that. Use media queries in a separate CSS file. JavaScript In all their tutorials, including their JavaScript Variables tutorial and ‚ÄúJavaScript Best Practices‚Äù they are using var although nowadays you should be using let or const. In ES2015 let and const have been added, let and const is supported by IE11 (IE11 represents almost 100% of current IE usage). And you can write in ES2015 and convert your code to ES5 with tools such as babel. And to be honest, nowadays you can dev in ES2015, since IE only represents ~2% of browsers usage. In all their tutorials, they do string concatenation although they could do string interpolation, which is very easy using template literals. In all their tutorials where they compare variables, they use == and != instead of using === and !==. In all their tutorials they mostly show traditional functions instead of arrow functions, even when it makes more sense. In their JavaScript introduction they show how JavaScript can modify HTML attribute values. The problem is that they inline the JavaScript inside an onclick attribut, which is a bad practice because it‚Äôs not very readable and it‚Äôs at the same level as inline css, they should have used a &amp;#x3C;script&amp;#x3E; tag. In their JavaScript Where To tutorial they don‚Äôt mention that when placing JavaScript code in the &amp;#x3C;head&amp;#x3E; you must be using defer or async attribute. In their JavaScript Output tutorial even though they warned that document.write should be used for debugging only, but honestly it shouldn‚Äôt even be mentioned. In their JavaScript Variables tutorial there are several examples of reporting several variables on the same line, without assignment. In their JavaScript Operators tutorial they don‚Äôt mention the ** operator. In their JavaScript Data Types tutorial they say, ‚ÄúYou can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.‚Äù It was a bug in the beginning, but this text could make think, wrongly that this behavior will change one day. No tutorial/documentation about the modern fetch API only about XMLHttpRequest. See why you should be using fetch and not XMLHttp In their JavaScript Objects tutorial they could have used short syntax for object methods like this { firstName: &amp;#x22;John&amp;#x22;, lastName : &amp;#x22;Doe&amp;#x22;, id : 1, method() { // code of the method here } } In their JavaScript Events tutorial they teach a bad practice of using html events instead using JavaScript events with the addEventListener method. In their JavaScript Arrays tutorial they could have taught for of to iterate over array like this for (const element of array) { ... } In their JavaScript Hoisting tutorial it would be much easier using let and const. In their JavaScript Best Practices tutorial declarations on top is now bad practice, let and const should be used instead. Use Parameter Defaults is now part of the syntax. In their JavaScript Validation tutorial addEventListener should be used, again. JavaScript Classes aren‚Äôt mentioned. JavaScript Promises aren‚Äôt mentioned. PHP In their PHP Introduction PHP5 is enough to show how outdated the tutorial is. In their PHP Installation tutorial PHP5 still and there is no real explanation on how to install PHP, it‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúLook at the doc and deal with it, we won‚Äôt tell you about php -S (php internal web server for development)‚Äù In their PHP Variables tutorial they use &quot; by default instead of &#39; even without interpolation. They use global variables, which is a bad practice as well. In their PHP Arrays tutorial they use the old long syntax array() although they should use the short syntax [] In their PHP Ajax tutorial their JavaScript and PHP codes are full of bad practices, and they don‚Äôt even talk about the fact that nowadays you should use the fetch API instead AJAX. See why you should be using fetch and not XMLHttp No tutorial about hashing passwords. Bootstrap In their Bootstrap Introduction they use Bootstrap 3, no needs to go further. W3.JS Their W3.JS library is heavy (12Ko) and doesn‚Äôt do a lot of things. W3.JS is like jQuery, heavy and useless nowadays, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt recommend using those two libraries. In 2018, a library that allows to directly interact with the DOM is fairly anti-pattern now that UX library like React or VueJS exist. Why is even w3schools site itself bad ? For this part I recommend you that you read this article. Fun Fact I was looking at the w3schools forum and I found this thread saying that someone cloned w3schools site. The cloned version is available here this is an outdated version of w3schools site, so you can explore the even more outdated tutorials, you can also see this meme by yourself They was using HTML tables for layout and by the way this is not a lamp üòÇ And I‚Äôm sure you can still find some funny things they were doing a few years ago. PS: If I forgot something, you can open an issue on the GitHub repository.
